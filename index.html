              Isn't it funny? An ancient religious monument is given a name
              'Monkey Temple' also the astonishing fact that it is included in
              the World Heritage Sites' list. Yes. Presenting you Swoyambhunath
              Temple, a complex atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, west of
              Kathmandu city in Nepal.From the top of hill,it has a really
              beautiful view of the city. There's a big stupa in the middle of
              the temple that's covered in prayer flags. You can walk around the
              stupa and spin the prayer wheels. There are also a lot of other
              smaller temples and shrines around the area. The stupa at
              Swoyambhunath is one of the most recognizable landmarks in
              Kathmandu and is a popular tourist destination. Swoyambhunath is
              one of the most sacred Buddhist sites in Nepal and is also revered
              by many Hindus. Remember the name 'Monkey Temple', this name is
              given as there are a lot of monkeys that live here. If you ever
              visit Kathmandu, I recommend you this place. But be careful with
              the activities monkeys do.

        <h2>Myth about the temple</h2>
        <p>
          Its is said that the Kathmandu Valley was once filled with water. The
          only land that was visible on surface water had a bloosm of Lotus .
          Then the Boddhisatva: a person with wisdom like Buddha, called
          Manjushree came and saw the possibility of human settlement there and
          thus cut the Chovar gorge with his sword which led water to flow out
          of the valley. Then the stup was raised from the place of Lotus. It is
          also said that Manjushree while raising the hill grew a long hair
          where lices were grown. Those lices later on transformed into the
          monkeys.

        <h2>The archietecture of the stupa and its symbolic meaning</h2>
        <div class="row last">
          <div class="rlast">
            <p>
              Swoyambhu is probably the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage
              sites. For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it is
              second only to Boudha. Swayambhu is the Hindu name. The complex
              consists of a stupa, a variety of shrines and temples, some dating
              back to the Licchavi period. A Tibetan monastery, museum and
              library are more recent additions. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and
              eyebrows painted on. Between them, the number one (in Nepal
              script) is painted in the fashion of a nose. There are also shops,
              restaurants and hostels. The site has two access points: a long
              staircase leading directly to the main platform of the temple,
              which is from the top of the hill to the east; and a car road
              around the hill from the south leading to the south-west entrance.
              When reached the top we can see the stupa that consists of a dome
              at the base which represents the world, on top of which is a cube
              structure, painted with eyes of Buddha looking in all four
              directions depicting that kathmandu valley is under the
              survillence of the Buddha's eyes. There are pentagonal toranas
              present above each of the four sides of the cube with Buddha
              reliefs on them. Behind and above the toranas there are thirteen
              tiers symbolizing that sentient beings have to go through the
              thirteen stages of spiritual realizations to reach enlightenment.
              Above all the tiers there is a small space above which the Gajur
              is present. There are five gilt Buddha shrines at the base of the
              stupa, all with a Buddha statue inside them. Equally five Tara
              shrines can be found here, but only four of them are gilt and
              actually house a Tara statue. The shrine of Vajradhatishori Tara,
              or White Tara, is empty.
